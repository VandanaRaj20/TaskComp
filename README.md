**Challenge:** Design and develop a better version of the existing web page.

Hello1 I am Vandana Rajesh (NYU ID: N14720690). I have completed the task as a part of the Graduate assistantship selection process. This repository contains the code I have typed from scratch to design the webpage. I have primarily  used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5 for this task. I incorporated a few changes in the web design.

**My explanation behind the designs**

1) I have changed each event into cards so that it will be easier for the users to associate the details pertaining to that event because of the border bounding the card.

 2) I have used Bootstrap ver.5 to make the website responsive.

 3) In the existing website, the buttons were designed to be solid colours, along with the register button. In my Design, I wanted to bring the main focus to the register button. So for 'View Brochure', I gave an outline button and when hovered will turn solid.
