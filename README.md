**Challenge:** Design and develop a better version of the existing web page.

Hello! I am Vandana Rajesh (NYU ID: N14720690). I have completed the task as a part of the Graduate assistantship selection process. This repository contains the code I have typed from scratch to design the webpage. I have primarily  used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap ver.5 for this task. I incorporated a few changes in the web design.

**Languages used:** HTML, CSS, bootstrap ver.5

**IDE:** Visual Studio Code 

**My explanation behind the designs**

1) I have changed each event into cards so that it will be easier for the users to associate the details about that event because of the border bounding the card.

 2) I have used Bootstrap ver.5 to make the website responsive.

 3) In the existing website, the buttons were designed to be solid colours, along with the register button. In my Design, I wanted to bring the main focus to the register button. So for 'View Brochure', I gave an outline button and when hovered will turn solid.

4) I made the dropdown menu icon visible so that users can navigate accordingly

5) I made the register button slightly bigger to draw attention and gave solid background colour, unlike the view brochure button. When hovered over the button, a small animation will take place.

6) When hovering over the cards, a soft shadow effect will take place to draw the focus on that particular card.

7) For the "Coming Soon!" section, I gave the image an opacity of 40% to illustrate that this event is not yet activated. The same is applied to its button

**I hope this helps you understand the reasons behind my design. If I have to make any changes or difficulties in viewing the website, please do let me know.**

Thank you!
