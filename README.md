**Challenge:** Design and develop a better version of the existing web page.

Hello1 I am Vandana Rajesh (NYU ID: N14720690). I have completed the task as a part of the Graduate assistantship selection process. This repository contains the code I have typed from scratch to design the webpage. I have primarily  used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5 for this task. I incorporated a few changes in the web design.

**My explanation behind the designs**

1) I have changed each event into cards so that it will be easier for the users to associate the details pertaining to that event because of the border bounding the card.
